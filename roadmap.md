## Roadmap of Desired Functionality

These are the big-picture things we want to add before the money runs out!


#### _Radiation Field and Density Fitting_

- use lmfit minimization to allow off-grid minimum $\chi^2$

- regularization technique to reduce unphysical spatial variation

#### _H2 Excitation Fitting_

- add full Roueff et al Table of H2 line parameters

- full support for map-based pixel-by-pixel fitting

- regularization technique to reduce unphysical spatial variation

- add Bayesian fitting via lmfit/emcee

#### _Models_

 - Add Kosma-Tau models

 - Add full set of Wolfire-Kaufman 2020-1 models

#### _Plotting_

- H2 plotter

  - plot maps of $T_{cold}, T_{hot}, N_{cold}, N_{hot}, N_{total}$, and $OPR$

  - for maps, have mouse-over show pop-up excitation diagram for that pixel

#### _Testing_

-  We seriously need more test code and an automated test suite

#### _Documentation_

- Always can use updating

- More notebook examples
